      "First, let me break down the numbers. She starts with 16 eggs a day. Then she eats three for breakfast every morning. So that's 3 eggs per day that she uses herself. Then she bakes muffins every day with four eggs. Wait, does that mean she uses four eggs for baking? So that's 4 eggs per day for muffins. \n",
      "\n",
      "So total eggs used for herself and muffins would be 3 + 4. Let me add that up: 3 plus 4 is 7. So she uses 7 eggs each day. Therefore, the remaining eggs she sells are 16 minus 7. Let me calculate that: 16 - 7 equals 9. So she has 9 eggs left to sell each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, each of those eggs is sold for $2. So to find out how much money she makes, I need to multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg. That would be 9 eggs times $2. Let me do that multiplication: 9 * 2 is 18. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, she makes $18 each day at the farmers' market. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 16 eggs. Subtract 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins: 16 - 3 - 4 = 9. Then 9 times 2 is 18. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem says she sells the remainder, so the calculation looks correct. So the answer should be $18.\n",
